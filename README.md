# Todo App 

> I know, another todo app! I created this as part of Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree program. This project aimed to teach how the MVC model worked using Python and PostgreSQL by building a CRUD ToDo Application.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* SQLAlchemy
* AJAX

## Concepts Learned
* Model View Controller (MVC) Pattern
* Getting user data in Flash through forms, URL query parameters, or JSON (in this project we used forms)
* Using AJAX to send data to Flask asynchronously through XMLHttpRequest or Fetch (in this project we used Fetch)
* Using sessions in controllers (try-except-finally)
* Migrations using Flask-Migration
